# Reflection Document

* Drive Full Name  : Lucas Podowski
* Partner Full Name: Harry Li
* Student ID: 001907164

Objective: 
* In this lab assignment you will analyze data on movies, their budgets, and their profits

Procedure:
* first understood problem, made high level steps, then coded
* key concepts: working with files, functions, and tables

results: 
* The results matched what was predicted
* I tried a few test cases but there may have been some that were not checked

reflection:
* One challenge was to figure out the high level steps. Another challenge was poor communication.
* We first worked on the algorithm, then I coded and tested the code.
* We overcame the high level steps with Dr. Zee's help by reminding us what to do. I overcame poor communication by
coding the program a day later by myself.
* I have become better at working with tables
* I think I learned what I was supposed to
* Working with Harry in class was ok, we talked a little about the algorithm and figured out the high level 
tasks together. Other than that we did not really work together. I completed the code and finished the algorithm.
